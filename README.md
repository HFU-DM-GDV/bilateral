# Bilateral filtering illustrated

Demonstration of Bilateral Filter Kernel Computation and Visualization. 

It provides an interactive plot where clicking on an intensity patch updates the displayed bilateral filter kernel based on the selected pixel's intensity. It is inspired by the illustration from [C. Tomasi and R. Manduchi, "Bilateral filtering for gray and color images," Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat. No.98CH36271), Bombay, India, 1998, pp. 839-846, doi: 10.1109/ICCV.1998.710815.,](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manduchi/Papers/ICCV98.pdf)
